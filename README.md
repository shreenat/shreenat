# Hello! I am Shreena.

## About Me
I am a Second Year Undergraduate Student at the University of Maryland majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Physics and Robotics. I am also at the home stretch of my Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students Honors Program Citation and am in my journey through the Break Through Tech AI/ML program to deep dive into the subject, learn from experts, and gain hands-on experience in real-world projects. I am currently in the search of an internship for the Summer 2026 where I can further hone my skills technical and professional skills and explore more about Neural Networks and their applications in Computer Vision and LLMs.

## Featured Project
I will be starting my Fall AI Studio Project in a few weeks. Look for updates here!

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages** : Java, Python, C, OCaml, Rust, Assembly Language
- **Python Libraries** : Pandas, Scikit Learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Keras, Matplotlib
- **IDEs and Coding environments** : Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab
- **Web Dev** : HTML/CSS and JavaScript ; also worked with the React Leaflet framework once
- Utilized ChatGPT Completion Model APIs
- Also familiar with Linux and Unix OS systems; proficient in Bash Shell; worked with GDB Debugger and Ghidra

## Key Projects
- **Cornell ML Foundations Project**<br>
This was the finale project of our summer-long ML course where I followed the ML Development Life Cycle to design a model that predicts the hours per week an individual spends at work based on Census data.<br>
  - Tools Used : Python Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, and Scipy.Stat packages<br>
  - Results : Improved the model's performance by almost 20% through model selection techniqes. Did not get very high performance results.<br>
  - Future Goals : To collect more relavent data and make design changes to improve the mode.<br>

- **City Notes Website**
  This was a hackthon project that I created with my friends. It allows you to anonymously place notes on a map and reflect on your vibes at different places. You can also read others' notes and learn more about a place.
    - Link : https://citynotes.vercel.app/
    - Tools Used : Firebase database, React Leaflet framework, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Linux Terminal, and Visual Studio Code

## Hobbies
I used to be a gymnast and played tennis in school. I enjoy learning the piano, watching movies, reading books, drawing, and sitting out in the sun in my free time! I love ice cream in all during all seasons and am always down to for a stroll outside.
